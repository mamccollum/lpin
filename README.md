# lpin
lpin -- Line Printer INput

## Huh?
`lpin` is a simple command that uses the standard ANSI escape codes to initiate a print job, take stdin as input, and then end the print job.

## Support
`lpin` is not well supported with most terminal emulators. Two confirmed working terminal emulators are KDE's Konsole and iTerm2.

## Usage
```sh
command | lpin
```
